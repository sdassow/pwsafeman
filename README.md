Experimental golang based password safe manager

## Motivation

Building another project used before failed and required too much effort in terms of getting scripting languages play well with heavy user interface bindings.
There are other golang based projects, and they mostly rely on heavy UI bindings as well, which made experimenting with something super lightweight very interesting.

So this project instead tries to be very lighweight using golang as language and fyne.io for the user interface.

Another aspect noticed was the lack of a pwsafe library, and it seems a good idea to fork existing code into a library for better sharing.
